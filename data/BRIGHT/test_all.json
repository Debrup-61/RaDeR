Do the results conform the expectation with Level of significance being 5%?\nTo determine if the results conform to the expectation with a level of significance of 5%, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean yield is equal to the expected yield of 12.0 quintals per hectare. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean yield is not equal to 12.0 quintals per hectare.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the sample data:\n\nMean (x̄) = (14.3 + 12.6 + 13.7 + 10.9 + 13.7 + 12.0 + 11.4 + 12.0 + 12.6 + 13.1) / 10 = 126.3 / 10 = 12.63\n\nNow, we calculate the standard deviation (s):\n\ns = sqrt(Σ(xi - x̄)^2 / (n - 1))\ns = sqrt((1.7^2 + 0.6^2 + 1.1^2 + (-1.73)^2 + 1.1^2 + (-0.63)^2 + (-1.23)^2 + (-0.63)^2 + 0.6^2 + 0.47^2) / 9)\ns ≈ 0.97\n\nNext, we calculate the t-value:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))\nt = (12.63 - 12) / (0.97 / sqrt(10))\nt ≈ 2.05\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test with a 5% level of significance and 9 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.262.\n\nSince the calculated t-value (2.05) is less than the critical t-value (2.262), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is True.",

Use Kepler's third law of planetary motion to predict the orbital period of Hyperion in days.\nKepler's third law states that the ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets is equal to the ratio of the cubes of the semi-major axes of their orbits. In this case, we have two moons of Saturn, Titan and Hyperion. Let T1 and T2 be the orbital periods of Titan and Hyperion, respectively, and R1 and R2 be their mean orbital radii.\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law:\n\n(T1^2 / T2^2) = (R1^3 / R2^3)\n\nWe are given T1 = 15.95 days, R1 = 1.22x10^9 m, and R2 = 1.48x10^9 m.

        "solution": "\\lim_{x \\to c} |f(x)| = 0. What is \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)?\nSince the limit of the absolute value of f(x) as x approaches c is 0, this means that f(x) must be approaching 0 as well. Therefore, the answer is 0.",

        "solution": "If there exists an ordered numbering of the nodes such that for each node there are no links going to a lower-numbered node, then there are no directed cycles in a directed graph. True or false?\nTrue. \n\nIf there exists an ordered numbering of the nodes such that for each node there are no links going to a lower-numbered node, then it means that the graph can be topologically sorted. A topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. Therefore, if a graph can be topologically sorted, it must be a DAG, which means there are no directed cycles in the graph. \n\nTherefore, the answer is True.",
