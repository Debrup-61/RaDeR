prompt_equiv = '''You are given a mathematical question, the gold/correct answer to the question, and a model generated solution with the final answer in boxed notation. Your job is to predict 'True' if the gold answer and the answer from the model generated solution are equivalent, otherwise 'False' if they are not equivalent.

Question: Imagine you're programming a video game that simulates the flight of a magical bird. The bird's flight path is determined by a spell that affects its speed and direction. According to the spell, the change in the bird's acceleration, minus twice the change in its speed, plus twice its current position equals zero. At the start of the game (time = 0), the bird is at the starting point (position = 0). When the game clock reaches the halfway point of the first day (time = π/2 hours), the bird has reached a position of 1 unit above the starting point. What is the bird's position at a quarter of the way through the first day (time = π/4 hours)?
Gold Answer: 0.322
Model Generated Soution: the given differential equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 2\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2x = 0\n\\]\n\nthis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. the characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\n\\[\nr^2 - 2r + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nsolving the characteristic equation:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2i}{2} = 1 \\pm i\n\\]\n\nthe roots are complex, so the general solution to the differential equation is of the form:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = e^t (a \\cos t + b \\sin t)\n\\]\n\nnext, we use the initial conditions to find the constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). at \\(t = 0\\), the position \\(x(0) = 0\\):\n\n\\[\nx(0) = e^0 (a \\cos 0 + b \\sin 0) = a = 0\n\\]\n\nso, \\(a = 0\\), and the solution simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = b e^t \\sin t\n\\]\n\nnext, we use the second initial condition at \\(t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), where the position \\(x\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1\\):\n\n\\[\nx\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = b e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = b e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cdot 1 = b e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\nsolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{1}{e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}\n\\]\n\nthus, the position function is:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} e^t \\sin t = e^{t - \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin t\n\\]\n\nfinally, we need to find the position of the bird at \\(t = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\nx\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = e^{\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\]\n\ntherefore, the bird's position at a quarter of the way through the first day (time = \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) hours) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}}}\n\\]
Prediction: True

Question: A company's profit (in thousands of dollars) from selling x units of a product is given by the function P(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 1. Find the profit when 4 units are sold.
Gold Answer: 54.0
Model Generated Solution: Substitute x = 4 into the profit function:\n\nP(4)=3(4)2+2(4)-1=3(16)+8-1=48+8-1= \\boxed{55}.
Prediction: False

Question: Imagine you're a data analyst working on a new predictive model. You've created a function that takes complex numbers as inputs to forecast stock prices. However, no matter what input you use, the forecasted price seems to remain the same. Assuming the forecasted price is determined by a mathematical function that takes complex numbers as inputs and the forecasted price never exceeds a certain level for any input, does this mean your forecasting function is applying a uniform prediction across all inputs?
Gold Answer: true
Model Generated Soution: given that \( f = u(z) + iv(z) \) is an entire function and \( |f(z)| \leq 1000 \) for all \( z \in \mathbb{c} \), we can use liouville's theorem. liouville's theorem states that any bounded entire function must be constant. here's the detailed reasoning: entire function: since \( f \) is entire, it is holomorphic (complex differentiable) everywhere in the complex plane \( \mathbb{c} \). bounded: the function \( f \) is bounded by 1000, meaning \( |f(z)| \leq 1000 \) for all \( z \in \mathbb{c} \).application of liouville's theorem: liouville's theorem directly applies here because \( f \) is an entire function that is also bounded. therefore, by liouville's theorem, \( f \) must be a constant function. so, the function \( f \) is constant, and the specific value it takes is some constant \( c \) such that \( |c| \leq 1000 \).\( \\boxed{f \\text{ is a constant function}} \)
