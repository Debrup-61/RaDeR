### Question:
Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let us represent the points as $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the complex plane. 
Step 2: In this case, Joe's point is $(1,2)$ and Gracie's point is $(-1,1)$. 
*Query for Retrieval*: The essential problem here is to find the distance between two points on the complex plane. This involves understanding and applying the concept of Euclidean distance. Specifically, the problem requires knowledge of how to represent points on the complex plane, understanding of the Euclidean distance formula for points in the complex plane and the ability to compute differences between real and imaginary parts of complex numbers. Representation of Points on the Complex Plane: Each point on the complex plane can be represented by a pair of coordinates (x,y), where x represents the real part and y represents the imaginary part of a complex number. For example, the point 1+2i can be written as (1,2), and the point −1+i can be written as (−1,1). Euclidean Distance Formula: The distance between any two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in a plane is given by the Euclidean distance formula: d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}. This formula calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a two-dimensional space.

### Question: 
What is the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: We need to find the smallest integer, $n$ that has exactly $10$ factors. 
*Query for Retrieval*: To solve the problem of finding the least positive integer with exactly 10 positive factors, we need to understand the relationship between the prime factorization of a number and the number of its divisors. Prime Factorization - Every positive integer can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers raised to some powers. For example, n= p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} where p_i​ are distinct primes and e_i​ are positive integers. Divisor Function - The number of positive divisors of a number n with prime factorization n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} is given by the formula: d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1). This formula counts all possible combinations of the exponents in the prime factorization. Finding the Least Positive Integer: To find the least positive integer with exactly 10 positive factors, we need to find the smallest n such that d(n)=10.

### Question:
In square $ABCD$, point $M$ is the midpoint of side $AB$ and point $N$ is the midpoint of side $BC$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $AMN$ to the area of square $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let each side of the square have length x. 
Step 2: Then AM = MB = BN = x/2
*Query for Retrieval*:  To solve the problem of finding the ratio of the area of triangle AMN to the area of square ABCD, we need to understand the geometric properties of the square and the triangle formed by specific points within it. Area of a Square - The area of a square with side length x is given by: A_square = x^2. Midpoints and Segment Lengths - Since M and N are midpoints of sides AB and BC respectively, their distances from the vertices are half the side length of the square. Area of Triangle Using Coordinates - The area of a triangle with vertices at (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), and (x_3, y_3) can be calculated using the determinant formula - A_triangle= \frac{1}{2} \left x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right.  

### Question:
Circle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?

### Response: 
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify the initial coordinates of the center of circle T, which are given as (−2,6).
Step 2: The circle T is reflected across the y-axis. 
Step 3: The y-axis has x=0 for all its points. 
*Query for Retrieval*: The problem involves transformations of geometric shapes, specifically reflections and translations. The key concepts and steps involved are Reflection Across the Y-Axis: Reflecting a point (x,y) across the y-axis changes the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate unchanged. The new coordinates of the point after reflection will be (−x,y). This concept is useful for determining the position of the circle's center after it is reflected across the y-axis. Translation - Translating a point (x,y) by moving it a certain number of units horizontally and vertically results in a new point (x+a,y+b), where a and b are the horizontal and vertical translations, respectively. In this problem, the translation involves moving the point 8 units down, which means a=0 and b=−8. This concept is necessary for determining the final position of the circle's center after the translation. By combining these concepts, we can determine the coordinates of the image of the center of circle T after both transformations.
