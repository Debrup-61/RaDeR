Given a math question, its partial solution (may be empty), and a retrieved theorem, do the following: Identify the preconditions of the theorem and explain why they hold in the given question. Using these preconditions, generate a general retrieval query that captures the key mathematical idea needed in the partial solution. Guidelines for the Query: (1) Do not mention the theorem's name. (2) Avoid direct wording or closely matching phrasing from the theorem. (3) Base the query on the state of the partial solution. (4) Use general mathematical symbols when necessary.

**Question**: A warehouse needs to store 65 identical boxes using a set of identical shelves, each of which can hold up to 8 boxes. What is the minimum number of shelves required to store all the boxes?
Partial solution: To determine the minimum number of shelves required, we divide the total number of boxes by the capacity of each shelf. Since the number of shelves must be a whole number, we round up to 9 shelves.
Theorem: If \\( n \\) items are put into \\( m \\) containers, with \\( n > m \\), then at least one container must contain more than one item.
Preconditions:(1) There are more items than containers. (2) The items are distributed into containers.
Why Preconditions are Satisfied in the Question: (1) The warehouse has 65 boxes (items) and needs to distribute them among shelves (containers), where each shelf can hold up to 8 boxes. (2) Since 65 is greater than 8, multiple boxes must be placed on each shelf to store all of them.
Query: Minimizing the number of boxes needed to store a given number of objects with fixed capacity constraints.

**Question**: Imagine you're an engineer designing a new water reservoir and need to calculate the amount of material needed to construct a dam. The shape of the dam's cross-section is described by the equation y=2^x, and you're focusing on the section from x=−1 to x=3. To estimate the volume of material required, you decide to break this section into 4 equal parts and use a method that approximates the area by connecting the points with straight lines to form trapezoids. How much area would you estimate is under the curve for this section?
Partial solution: 
Theorem: The area under a curve \(y = f(x)\) from \(a\) to \(b\) can be approximated by dividing the interval \([a, b]\) into \(n\) equal subintervals and using the trapezoidal rule: \[ \\text{Area} \\approx \\frac{\Delta x}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \cdots + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \\right] \] where \(\Delta x = \\frac{b - a}{n}\) and \(x_i = a + i \Delta x\).
Preconditions: (1) The function \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([a, b]\). (2) The interval \([a, b]\) is divided into \(n\) equal subintervals. (3) The number of subintervals \(n\) must be a positive integer.
Why Precondition is Satisfied in the Question: (1) The function \(y = 2^x\) is continuous over the interval \([-1, 3]\). (2) The interval \([-1, 3]\) is divided into 4 equal subintervals. (3) The number of subintervals \(n = 4\) is a positive integer.
Query: We need to approximate the area under a curve between two points by dividing the region into equal segments and using a method that connects these points with straight lines to form trapezoids.

**Question**: A gardener is designing a flower path across a garden with patches of grass arranged in a tile pattern. The path extends from the house on the west side (at x=−10) to the gate on the east side (at x=10). The flowers are placed along a curve that follows the graph of a quadratic function f(x)=a+bx+cx^2. The gardener knows the positions of the flowers at x=1, x=2, and x=3, where the corresponding y-values are -1, 3, and 13, respectively. However, the gardener has forgotten the y-position of the flower at x=−1, but remembers that the flowers' positions all follow the quadratic equation. Can you determine the missing y-position for the flower at x=−1?
Partial Solution: To find the y-position of the flower at \( x = -1 \), we need to determine the quadratic equation \( f(x) = a + bx + cx^2 \) that fits the given points \( (1, -1) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, 13) \). We have the points \( (1, -1) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, 13) \) that the quadratic equation \( f(x) = a + bx + cx^2 \) must satisfy. Substituting these points into the equation, we get a system of equations. 
Theorem: Given a system of linear equations in the form \(a_1x + b_1y = c_1\), \(a_2x + b_2y = c_2\), and \(a_3x + b_3y = c_3\), the system has a unique solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero.
Preconditions:(1) The system of equations must have the same number of equations as variables. (2) The determinant of the coefficient matrix must be non-zero for a unique solution.
Why Preconditions are Satisfied in the Question: (1) We have three points \((1, -1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 13)\) and three unknowns \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), so the system is consistent with the number of equations and variables. (2) The determinant of the coefficient matrix formed by the system of equations is non-zero, ensuring a unique solution.
Query: Solve a system of linear equations with the same number of equations and variables.
