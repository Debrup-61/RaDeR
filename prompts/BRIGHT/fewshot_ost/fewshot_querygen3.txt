(2) Degree of a Polynomial – Helps determine the leading term in division. (3) Division Algorithm for Polynomials – States that for polynomials f(z) and g(z), there exist unique polynomials q(z) (quotient) and r(z) (remainder) such that: f(z)=g(z)⋅q(z)+r(z),where deg⁡(r)<deg⁡(g), (4) Monomial Division – Dividing the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. (5)  Multiplication and Subtraction of Polynomials – Steps needed in the long division process. A good query for retrieval should focus on these concepts: Polynomial long division of (3z4−4z3+5z2−11z+2) by 2+3z, quotient of polynomial division, polynomial division theorem, polynomial remainder theorem.

Question: Many states use a sequence of three letters followed by a sequence of three digits as their standard license-plate pattern. Given that each three-letter three-digit arrangement is equally likely, the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome (a three-letter arrangement or a three-digit arrangement that reads the same left-to-right as it does right-to-left) is $\dfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
Intermediate solution: To calculate the probability of a three-letter palindrome, we first note that there are 26 possible choices for each letter. The first and last letters must be the same, so there are 26 choices for the first and last letters, and 26 choices for the middle letter. 
Query for Retrieval: Probability calculation of a license plate with at least one palindrome requires knowledge of key concepts such as (1) Counting Principles – Fundamental combinatorial techniques such as the multiplication principle. (2) Probability Basics – The calculation of probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes. (3) Palindrome Definition – Understanding how palindromes are structured in three-letter and three-digit sequences. (4) Complement Principle – A useful technique in probability to find the probability of an event occurring by subtracting the probability of its complement from 1. (5) Inclusion-Exclusion Principle – Necessary when calculating the probability of at least one palindrome occurring in either the letter sequence or the digit sequence. (6) Relatively Prime Numbers – Ensuring the final probability fraction is simplified correctly. A good query for retrieval should focus on these concepts: probability of a three-letter palindrome, probability of a three-digit palindrome, probability of at least one palindrome in a license plate, inclusion-exclusion in probability, combinatorial probability in license plate design.

Question: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year? 
Intermediate solution: He writes each friend 3*2=6 pages a week.
Query for Retrieval: Total pages written by James in a year requires knowledge of key concepts such as: (1) Basic Multiplication – Calculating total pages written per week and per year using repeated multiplication.(2) Unit Conversion – Converting weeks to years (52 weeks in a year). (3) Arithmetic Progressions (if applicable) – If the writing pattern follows a structured increase or change over time, arithmetic sequences may be useful. A good query for retrieval should focus on these concepts: total pages written in a year, weekly writing pattern multiplication, calculating yearly output from weekly activities, multiplication and unit conversion in daily habits.
